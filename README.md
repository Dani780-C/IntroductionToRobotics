# Introduction to Robotics (2022 - 2023)

Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework 1

### Tasks:
  * Components: RBG LED (1 minimum), potentiometers (3 minimum),
resistors and wires (per logic).  
  * Technical Task: Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of the
color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done
with digital electronics (aka you must read the value of the potentiome-
ter with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected
to the led.  
  * Coding task: Coding style is of utmost importance. You must have a
perfectly clean code in order to receive the maximum grade. Keep in mind
that magic numbers are not accepted, although you might see them in the
lab (as a trade-off for speed). Remember to be consistent in your style,
check the style guide and the provided style document and use correct
spacing.
